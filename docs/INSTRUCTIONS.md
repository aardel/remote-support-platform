# Direct instructions (docs and GitHub)

Use these when you want to apply docs and GitHub updates yourself. No UI or server operation changes—just copy-paste.

---

## 1. GitHub repository description

1. Open your repo on GitHub: `https://github.com/aardel/remote-support-platform`
2. Click **Settings** (or the gear icon).
3. In **General**, find **Description**.
4. Paste this (or edit as you like):

```
Browser-based remote support: Electron helper + WebRTC screen share, mouse/keyboard control, file transfer. Self-hosted.
```

5. Save.

## 2. Commit current docs and agent-related changes

From the repo root, run:

```bash
git add README.md package.json .env.example CONTRIBUTING.md CHANGELOG.md \
  docs/API_AND_EVENTS.md docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md docs/SECURITY.md \
  docs/DEPENDENCIES.md docs/UI_GUIDELINES.md docs/ROADMAP.md \
  frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.css

git status
# Optional: add .cursor/ if you want agents and skills in the repo
# git add .cursor/

git commit -m "Docs: API contract, SECURITY, DEPENDENCIES, UI guidelines, ROADMAP; README and CONTRIBUTING; Dashboard search; passing test script"
```

To push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## 3. (Optional) Add agents and skills to the repo

If you want the team to use the same agents and skills:

```bash
git add .cursor/
git commit -m "Add .cursor/ agents and skills for workflow and approval"
git push origin main
```

If you prefer to keep `.cursor/` local, add it to `.gitignore` instead:

```bash
echo ".cursor/" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore .cursor (local agents/skills)"
```
